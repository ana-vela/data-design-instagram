			<h3>Persona</h3>
			<p>Name: McKenna Shutterfly</p>
			<p>Age: 26</p>
			<p>Profession: McKenna is a new freelance photographer in Albuquerque. She wants to share the photographs she has taken around the city and highlight her best photos from various gigs.</p>
			<p>Technology: McKenna invested in professional equipment for photography. She also uses her iPhone for photos when she sees a great photo opportunity and she doesn't have her professional equipment with her.</p>
			<p>Attitudes and Behaviors: McKenna is still working full-time in retail, so she can only dedicate time to her photography when she is not working. She hopes to transition to photography full-time when she gets more consistent gigs.</p>
			<p>Frustations and Needs: She does not have a website yet, so Instagram is one of the various ways she is posting her work via social media to find more clients. She has a limited time to post photos, so she needs a quick way to get her work online.</p>
			<p>Goal: McKenna wants to post photos regularly, so she needs to be able to post photos easily. She also wants to add tags to the post quickly as well. Once she gets a website, she wants to add a link to her Instagram page so that potential clients can directed to her official page.</p>
